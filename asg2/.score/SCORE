First, copy all files from the grading directory into the
student's directory.  For each point deduction, give a reason.
Numbers in parens are the max points for each check.

*****************************************************************

SOURCE CODE /30 points

    Note:  minimum 1 point for this section, no matter what.

    (3)  checksource (look in file check.log):
         Deduct 1 point for 0..5 complaints, 2 points for 6..15
         complaints, and 3 points for 16+ complaints
          
    (3)  Decent indentation and use of meaningful variable names

    (3)  All output done by class jxref, none in container classes

    (3)  implemented listmap as a separate class

    (3)  implemented intqueue as a separate class and uses
         the head and tail pointers as in the original code

    (3)  listmap.insert uses prev and curr pointers to find
         insertion point

    (3)  listmap.insert does insert in a second phase, but does
         not duplicate an entry

    (3)  jxref.xref_file modified appropriately to do the job,
         and inappropriate code from the sample is removed

    (3)  jxref.xref_file uses iterators defined in listmap and
         intqueue to print the results.

    (3)  error messages for files not accessible
    

*****************************************************************

PROGRAM TESTING /30 points

    mk.test runs the program runprogram.perl and generates output
    files.  check on the various different tests
    runprogram.perl generates files *.err for stderr, *.out for
    stdout and *.log containing the exit status

    Note:  0 points for this section if the program did not compile.

    (3)  gmake worked and built the jar file (see gmake.log)
         If, not build the jar yourself.

    (3)  exit status was 0 normally and 1 when a file could not
         be accessed

    (3)  none of the test runs crashed on any kind of exception
         with traceback printed

    (3)  output same as pxref program.
 
    (3)  output same as pxref program, but only prints words and
         counts but no xref numbers.  [this is for students with
         a partial implemention and no intqueue]

    (3)  counts are correct

    (3)  line numbers are correct

    (3)  no missing words

    (3)  error messages to stderr, normal output to stdout.

    (3)  words are printed in lexicographic order

SUBTOTAL=
min 1, max 60

If pair programming, TOTALSCORE = SUBTOTAL - TOTAL1.
If not, TOTALSCORE = SUBTOTAL.

TOTALSCORE=
min 1, max 60
