This is a small file that can be used to test your program.
Also see the files in the .score subdirectory.
The initial program does not do much but dump the input in debug
format.
You can test your program by running:
   pfmt.perl .... >output1
   jfmt .... >output2
   diff output1 output2
where .... are various arguments that might be supplied.
When you run diff, if your program works, it should not print anything.
