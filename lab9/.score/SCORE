For any point deduction, note it in the left margin and add a
comment under it indicating why the loss of points.  Assign a
point value for each between 0 and the max indicated in parens.

DO NOT DEDUCT POINTS FOR THE FOLLOWING LINT MESSAGES:
function returns value which is ... ignored

run mk.build
ruh mk.tests if mk.build succeeded

*****************************************************************

CODE = 15 points

   Check each of the following and assign between 0 and 2 points
   for each.

   (2) checksource did not complain

   (2) lint did not complain (except for msg about ret val ignored)

   (2) numsort, linesort each had a correct comparison function

   (3) each had a read loop that stops as per specs

   (3) inssort correctly used memcpy to move elements around

   (3) correctly allocated a tmp buffer using malloc, alloca,
       or a variable dimensioned array

code total=
min 1, max 15

*****************************************************************

TESTING = 15 points

For this section, verify that inssort.c is actually called,
and there is no monkey business about calling some other sorting
function, or hand coding different sorts for each.
Assign 0 points to this section if inssort void* was not called.

For each of the following assign up to 4 points
Assign 0 points for any test run that seg faults

   (4) runprogram.perl -0num.data -oout.test.num numsort

   (4) runprogram.perl -0line.data -oout.test.lines linesort

   (4) valgrind --leak-check=full numsort <num.data
       reports no memory leaks
   
   (4) valgrind --leak-check=full linesort <line.data
       reports no memory leaks

If everything is correct assign max 15 points, not 16.

testing total=
min 0, max 15

*****************************************************************

SUBTOTAL=
min 1, max 30

If pair programming, TOTALSCORE = SUBTOTAL - TOTAL2.
If not, TOTALSCORE = SUBTOTAL.
