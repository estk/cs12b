First, copy all files from the grading directory into the
student's directory.  For each point deduction, give a reason.
Numbers in parens are the max points for each check.

*****************************************************************

SOURCE CODE /30 points

    Note:  minimum 1 point for this section, no matter what.

    (3)  checksource (look in file check.log):
         3 pts if 0 to  5 complaints; 2 pts if 6 to 15 complaints;
         1 pt if 16 to 30 complaints; 0 pts if 31 or more complaints.
          
    (3)  Reasonable indentation and use of meaningful variable names
         No one-letter identifiers.

    (3)  Added code to airport.java to scan for -d option

    (3)  Command line args analysis and print err msgs if options
         not correct.

    If they used java.util.TreeMap, assign 0 for all of the following
    six items.

    (3)  Code to dump tree indebug format

    (3)  Used auxlib to print error messages.

    (3)  Implemented get in their treemap to perform binary search

    (3)  Implemented put in their treemap to insert if not found.

    (3)  Code for both get and put uses binary search, not linear.

    (3)  For insert, if duplicate key, no new node created.
         Value field changed, but node stays the same.

total points source code=
min 1, max 30.

*****************************************************************

PROGRAM TESTING /30 points

    mk.test runs the program runprogram.perl and generates output
    files.  check on the various different tests
    runprogram.perl generates files *.err for stderr, *.out for
    stdout and *.log containing the exit status

    Note:  0 points for this section if the program did not compile.

    (3)  gmake worked and built the jar file (see gmake.log)
         If, not build the jar yourself.  Jar file must be called
         airport.

    (3)  exit status was 0 normally and non-zero when a file could not
         be accessed

    (3)  Error messages were printed for nonexistent files.

    (3)  none of the test runs crashed on any kind of exception
         with traceback printed

    (3)  Inorder traversal with -d option produced sorted output.
         The input db files were cooked so that some balancing
         happened.  Balancing is not part of the assignment.

    (3)  Inorder traversal depth numbers are reasonably correct.

    (3)  Test -otest0-part

    (3)  Test -otest1-part

    (3)  Test -otest0-full

    (3)  Test -otest1-full

subtotal testing=

If they used java.util.TreeMap, DIVIDE SUBTOTAL TESTING BY 2,
giving total points testing.  If they did not use it, transfer
total points testing = subtotal testing.

total points testing=
min 0, max 30

*****************************************************************

SUBTOTAL=
min 1, max 60

If pair programming, TOTALSCORE = SUBTOTAL - TOTAL1.
If not, TOTALSCORE = SUBTOTAL.

TOTALSCORE=
min 1, max 60
