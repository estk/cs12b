Copy all of the files from this directory into the student's
submit directory.

Student:

For any point deduction, note it in the left margin and add a
comment under it indicating why the loss of points.  Assign a
point value for each between 0 and the max indicated in parens.

DO NOT DEDUCT POINTS FOR THE FOLLOWING LINT MESSAGES:
function returns value which is ... ignored

run mk.build
ruh mk.tests if mk.build succeeded

*****************************************************************

CODE = 15 points

   Check each of the following and assign between 0 and 2 points
   for each.  If the total is 16, record 15 instead.

   (2) checksource did not complain

   (2) lint did not complain (except for return value ignored msg)

   (2) uses getopt to check for the -d option

   (2) uses scanf to read numbers and checks results (nsort)

   (2) uses fgets to read lines (lsort)

   (2) uses strcmp to compare lines when inserting (lsort)

   (2) assert not null after every malloc (both)

   (2) uses free to release allocated space (both)

code total=
min 1, max 15

*****************************************************************

TESTING = 15 points

   Each test is run with good.in, bad.in, -d good.in, and bcheck.
   For each of the following items, assign 2 points for the results
   of nsort and 2 points for results of lsort.

   (4) Good tests, correct outout?
       - nsort (2)
       - lsort (2)

   (4) All tests, err messages for bad tests to stderr.
       All tests, exit status correct (0 = OK, 1 = bad).
       - nsort (2)
       - lsort (2)

   (4) Debug -d tests, output in correct format?
       - nsort (2)
       - lsort (2)

   (4) For bcheck runs (*.dbx), is 0 memory leak reported?
       - nsort (2)
       - lsort (2)

   Out of the total of 16, deduct 5 points if any of the tests
   reported a bus error, seg fault, or core dump.  Record a
   final score for this segment of between 0 to 15 inclusive,
   no negative numbers, and no 16.

If pair programming, TOTALSCORE = SUBTOTAL - TOTAL2.
If not, TOTALSCORE = SUBTOTAL.
